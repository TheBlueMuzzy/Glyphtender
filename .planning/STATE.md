AUTONOMOUS (Muzzy asleep, 2026-09-30): Sprint 02 — The garden's rules work (F04 engine, F05 word list, F06 Magic, F03 UI kit). Status board = SPRINT.md ticks.

## Where we are
Stage: develop · Milestone: v0.2 Plant a garden · Sprint: 02 · Doing: F04 + F03 · Branch: dev/alpha · Version: 0.0.0 · Live: none yet

## Key facts
**Remake.** Web remake of the Unity game. The original is read-only reference at `../glyphtender-original` (GitHub `TheBlueMuzzy/glyphtender-original`, renamed from `Glyphtender` 2026-09-30). Never copy it wholesale — pull ideas/assets across deliberately. Digest: `.planning/research/original-digest.md`.
**AI source of truth** is the original's branch `festive-booth` (goal-selection model), not its `main`.
**Muzzy's direction (2026-09-30):** phone (portrait AND landscape) + desktop — do responsive properly · first release = strong pass-and-play (AI replaces a seat next; online = "P0.5", reuse Roll Better's rooms if cheap) · tutorial not yet · UI kit **Cozy** style · think critically vs industry standards, don't just port.
**BMUZ stress test:** log BMUZ gaps in `~/.claude/config/bmuz/reviews/2026-09-30-glyphtender-remake/FINDINGS.md` as we go.
**Default branch:** main. Work branch: `dev/alpha`.
**Run:** `npx vite --host --port 5180` (dev port 5180) · tests `npm test` · sketch check `npm run e2e:sketch` (needs the dev server).
