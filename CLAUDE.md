## Capturing User Context

**Proactively capture important information Muzzy shares:**
- If he mentions design decisions, preferences, or insights worth preserving → add to appropriate .md file
- Use judgment: not everything needs documenting, but vision/decisions/learnings should be captured
- `<claude>` and `<handoff>` are explicit commands, but you should recognize important info without them

## Session Workflow

### Starting a Session
1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md in C:\Users\Muzzy\Documents\UnityProjects\Glyphtender) for current state
2. Check git log for recent changes
3. If user says <handoff> → read HANDOFF.md for full project context in C:\Users\Muzzy\Documents\UnityProjects\Glyphtender

### During a Session
- Use TodoWrite to track multi-step tasks
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Update "Current Work" section as progress is made

### Version Tracking (IMPORTANT)
**Unity sometimes doesn't recompile code.** To verify changes are active:
1. Before asking Muzzy to test, increment BUILD_VERSION in `MainMenuScreen.cs:129`
2. Tell Muzzy which version to look for (e.g., "Look for v744")
3. The version appears in red text at the top of the main menu
4. If version doesn't match, Unity needs manual refresh/recompile

### Ending a Session / Commit Command
1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Update this file's "Current Work" and "Known Issues" sections
4. If significant progress: update "Session Log" below
5. Push to remote
6. **IMPORTANT:** If in a worktree, update the main repo copy here C:\Users\Muzzy\Documents\UnityProjects\Glyphtender first, then do the worktree versions

### File Sync (Worktrees)
Main repo: `C:\Users\Muzzy\Documents\UnityProjects\Glyphtender`
Worktrees are at: `C:\Users\Muzzy\.claude-worktrees\Glyphtender\<worktree-name>`

**CRITICAL: Unity runs from the main repo, NOT the worktree!**
- After editing ANY scripts in a worktree, ALWAYS copy them to the main repo so Unity sees the changes
- Example: After editing `BoardRenderer.cs` in worktree, run:
  ```
  cp "C:\Users\Muzzy\.claude-worktrees\Glyphtender\bold-shirley\Unity\GlyphtenderUnity\Assets\Scripts\Unity\BoardRenderer.cs" "C:\Users\Muzzy\Documents\UnityProjects\Glyphtender\Unity\GlyphtenderUnity\Assets\Scripts\Unity\BoardRenderer.cs"
  ```
- This applies to ALL script files (.cs), not just .md files
- Muzzy may do manual editing on the main repo versions, so they are the source of truth for .md files

## Current Work

**Phase 5.4: Online Play Phase Bug Fixes** (IN PROGRESS)

Working on fixing online multiplayer bugs. Local 1v1 works.

### What's Working
- Auth → Lobby → Relay → Connection established
- Both players see board and can interact
- NetworkGameBridge spawns and syncs correctly
- Draft placements sync between players
- **Glyphling prefab system** - same object from hand → board (no destroy/recreate)
- **Tile prefab system** - same lifecycle as glyphlings!
- **Runeblossoms visible during refresh phase selection**
- **Local 1v1 fully working**
- **FIXED: Glyphling duplication in online mode** (v751)
- **FIXED: Cycle mode (refresh phase) now works in online mode** (v752)

### Current Testing (v752)
**Look for v752 in red text at top of main menu** - this confirms Unity compiled the latest code.

### Recent Fixes

**Glyphling duplication (v751):**
- Root cause: `ConfirmDraftPlacement()` was returning early in online mode without placing the glyphling or confirming the ghost object
- This left the ghost orphaned, and `RefreshGlyphlings` created a duplicate
- Fix: Host now applies draft placements locally AND sends to network (no early return)
- The RPC callback's "already has glyphling" check correctly skips for host

**Cycle mode / Refresh phase (v752):**
- Root cause: `OnNetworkTurnConfirmed` wasn't checking if words were formed and always ended turn immediately
- Fix: Added cycle mode detection - if no words formed, enters cycle mode instead of ending turn
- Added network sync for cycle completion via `SendCycleToNetwork`
- Added `EnterCycleModeFromNetwork` and `ExitCycleModeFromNetwork` methods

### Remaining Issues
- Turn indicator may still be stuck after refresh phase - needs testing

---

## Known Issues

1. **Turn indicator may be stuck after refresh phase** - P2 may show "waiting for player 1..." even though it's P2's turn. Needs testing after v752 cycle mode fix.

2. **Hex directions may be incorrect** - Leyline movement paths may not work correctly. Need to verify `HexCoord.Directions` array.

## Working with Muzzy

- **Don't pander** — Tell him when logic is flawed
- **Break into steps** — Avoid overwhelming with too much at once
- **Ask clarifying questions** — Avoid assumption errors
- **He's not a coder** — Strong logic, limited technical vocabulary
- **He spots logic mistakes** — Use him as design sanity-check

**Don't:**
- Treat word scoring as primary AI goal (area control first!)
- Use Canvas UI (3D UI only)
- Add features before current phase works

---

## Key Architecture Points

**Core/Unity Separation:** All game logic is pure C# in Core/. Unity layer only handles rendering/input.

**Online Mode Detection:**
```csharp
// Use GlyphtenderLobby.IsHost (not NetworkManager.IsHost - timing issues)
// NetworkedGameManager.IsOnlineGame checks PlayMode + active network session
// NetworkedGameManager.LocalPlayer = Yellow (host) or Blue (guest)
// NetworkedGameManager.IsLocalPlayerTurn guards input
```

**NetworkGameBridge:** Is a NetworkBehaviour, requires NetworkObject component, must be spawned by host after StartHost().

**Key Events:**
- `GameManager.OnGameStateChanged` - Any state change
- `GameManager.OnGameInitialized` - Game started
- `GameManager.OnDraftComplete` - Draft phase finished
- `GameManager.OnTurnEnded` - Turn completed

## Session Log

### 2026-01-05 (Phase 5.4 - Online Play Phase Bug Fixes)
- Fixed glyphling/tile size on board (changed `glyphlingSize` from 1.0 to 1.8)
- Fixed runeblossom selection during refresh phase (uniform quad scaling)
- Fixed green square during tile drag (material reapplication)
- Fixed glyphling identity mismatch during draft (pass selected glyphling to PlaceDraftGlyphling)
- Fixed ghost tile not converting to permanent on confirm (removed premature HideGhostTile)
- Updated all tile size calculations to use `hexSize * glyphlingSize`
- Local 1v1 now fully working!
- **FIXED: Online glyphling duplication (v751)** - Host now applies draft locally + sends to network
- **FIXED: Cycle mode in online play (v752)** - Added network sync for refresh phase

### 2026-01-04 (Phase 5.4 - Glyphling Prefab Lifecycle)
- Created glyphling prefab system (Quad-based with materials)
- Same object from hand → board (no destroy/recreate)

- Added BoxCollider for prefab interaction

### 2026-01-04 (Phase 5.4 - Glyphling Color & Turn Sync Fix)
- Fixed glyphling prefab not getting material applied (was white on host)
- Fixed `Update()` trapped pulsing to use `GetPlayerMaterial()` for all 4 players
- Added `GameManager.NotifyNetworkDraftPlacement()` for network to fire events
- Now `OnNetworkDraftPlacementConfirmed` properly fires `OnDraftComplete` and `OnGameStateChanged`

### 2026-01-04 (Phase 5.4 - Play Phase Sync)
- Simplified ConfirmMove network condition (was requiring 7 conditions, now just IsOnlineGame)
- Added DontDestroyOnLoad to NetworkedGameManager
- Added debug logging for material assignment in BoardRenderer
- Fixed Update loop to use GetPlayerMaterial for all 4 players (was hardcoded Yellow/Blue)
- TurnIndicator now subscribes to OnOnlineModeInitialized event

- HandController hides glyphlings when not local player's turn
- GameManager routes draft placement through network in online mode
- NetworkedGameManager applies received draft placements

### 2026-01-04 (Phase 5.1-5.3)
- NetworkServices, GlyphtenderLobby, GlyphtenderRelay created
